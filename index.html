          <strong>Bio:</strong><br>
          Rapha's pool has been online since May 2021. Having no prior background in technology, Rapha
          has taught himself many of the fundemental skills required to operate a stake pool. Since then, he has been
          an active member in the Cardano community, and has acquired skills in many domains; such as learning Haskell,
          Web Development, Dev Ops and more. Since December 2021, Rapha has also been one of SundaeSwap's Scoopers, batching
          transactions for the popular DeFi protocol.
